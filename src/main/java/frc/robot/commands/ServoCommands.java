    //TODO: Task 6-Write commands to move the arm up, down, and to a specific preset. The latter should be done by taking in an integer input.
    //Name them servoUpCommand, servoDownCommand, and servoPresetCommand. The presets are in the constants file.
    //NOTE: To make servoPresetCommand work properly with the Command system, you will need to make a non-Instant Command, one that ends when the servo's movement is complete.
    //However, because the library is programmed strangely, you only get the angle you set the servo to, not the actual angle it is at during any point in time. (ie if you set the servo to move to 90 degrees from 0 degrees and you called getAngle immediately after, before any movement occurs, you simply get the value 90)
    //The speed the servo moves is stored in Constants. Use it and System.currentTimeMillis() to determine how long the servo will move for, and set the end condition to be
    //when the time elapsed is greater than or equal to the time the servo moves.
